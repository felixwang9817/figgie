      <p>Once 4 players are loaded, press Start Game to receive your cards and start trading.</p>

      <p>You can enter the following commands:
        <ul>
          <li><span>SUIT at X</span> to make an offer, e.g. <span>spades at 10</span>. You must have a card of SUIT to sell.</li>
          <li><span>X bid for SUIT</span> to make a bid, e.g. <span>5 bid for hearts</span>. This will trade if there's currently an offer of equal or lower price.</li>
          <li><span>take SUIT</span> to buy SUIT at the current best offer price. Only valid if there's an offer.</li>
          <li><span>sell SUIT</span> to sell SUIT at the current best bid price. Only valid if there's a bid.</li>
          <li><span>clear</span> or <span>out</span> to clear all your bids and offers.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
